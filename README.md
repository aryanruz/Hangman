# Hangman
hangman game

Hangman is a word-guessing game typically played by two players
STEP 1:
Choose a Word: One player thinks of a secret word and writes down a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the word.
STEP 2:
Guessing Letters: The other player take turns guessing letters they think are in the word.
STEP 3:
Marking Guesses: If a guessed letter is in the word, the first player fills in the blanks with that letter in the correct positions. If the letter is not in the word, the first player draws part of a hangman.
STEP 4:
Winning and Losing: The guessing continues until the word is fully revealed (the guesser wins) or the hangman is fully drawn (the guesser loses). The number of incorrect guesses allowed before the hangman is fully drawn can vary, but it usually consists of 6-8 parts. After this you can play again.
